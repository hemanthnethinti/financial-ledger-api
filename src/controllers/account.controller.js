/**
 * Account Controller
 * ------------------
 * This file is responsible for handling HTTP requests related to accounts.
 * For this implementation, controller logic is kept inside app.js
 * to keep the flow simple and explicit.
 *
 * This file exists to demonstrate intended layered architecture
 * and can be used for future refactoring.
